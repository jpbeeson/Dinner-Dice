### Objective: 

Cooking at home can be tiring and repetitive. It’s easy to fall into a routine of making the same meals week after week, and going to a new restaurant might be difficult for some given current events. Our app Dinner Dice will help make quarantine dinners just a little more fun. Select your dietary restrictions, and try a new recipe. Add a delicious cocktail and make it a date night!

### User Story:
